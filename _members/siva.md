Sivasubramanian is a Scientist at the National Agri-Food and Biomanufacturing Institute, Mohali. His academic journey began with a B.Tech in Biotechnology from SASTRA University, Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu. He then pursued a one-year Masterâ€™s course in Genetics at the Department of Genetics, University of Delhi South Campus as part of his Ph.D. program. This course provided him with a renewed understanding of genetics and laid a strong foundation for his doctoral research.

Further in his Ph.D. from the same department with Prof. Jagreet Kaur, he focussed on the genetics of _Alternaria_ Blight resistance in _Arabidopsis thaliana_. His research explored plant-pathogen interactions and resistance mechanisms, driving his interest in solving critical challenges in agriculture. Following his Ph.D., Siva worked as a Research Associate with Prof. Deepak Pental at the Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants, University of Delhi South Campus. 

In 2018, he joined the National Agri-Food Biotechnology Institute (NABI), Mohali, initially as a DST-INSPIRE Faculty and currently as a Scientist D. With expertise in plant-pathogen interactions, genomics, and quantitative genetics, his work focuses on understanding plant diseases and developing innovative solutions to improve crop resilience and productivity. He has led several major research projects aimed at engineering disease resistance in crops like mustard and rice, with funding from prestigious agencies. His contributions to science include numerous publications in international journals and the mentoring of Ph.D. students, postdocs, and trainees.
